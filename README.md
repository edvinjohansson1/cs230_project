# cs230_project

This repository started out as a clone of the https://github.com/LanternD/cse842-amazon-review-helpfulness-prediction repository, and has now been modified to fit our problem formulation of predicting helpfulness of Amazon reviews using a CNN. 

The original repository was built on Tensorflow 1, and we are now in the process of migrating it to Tensorflow 2. 

Expect to soon also find an implementation of an unsupervised learning solution to the problem, which will hopefully achieve comparable- or better results than the supervised one above.
